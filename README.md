# Two-Grid-Examples

CSS layout is a bit complicated. There's a lot to learn, and different browsers can behave in vastly different ways. [CanIUse.com](http://caniuse.com/) is a useful site that lets you check browser support for HTML, CSS, and JS features.

## Gridly

If you want a lightweight grid, without much in the way of options, have a look [Gridly](http://ionicabizau.github.io/gridly/example/). It uses Flexbox, so it won't work every browser. Here's the [browser support for Flexbox](http://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox).

Have a look at [an example here](gridly.html), or [on JS Bin](https://jsbin.com/wowisa/edit?html,css,output).

## Bootstrap's Grid

If you want something with more options and control, you could look at one of the more popular Front-end Frameworks: [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). It has a lot of stuff in it, but for now we're only interested in the [the Grid section](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid).

Have a look at [an example here](bootstrap-grid.html), or [on JS Bin](https://jsbin.com/majaro/edit?html,css,output).

## But wait, there's more!

If you want to learn more about Front-end Frameworks in more detail, check out [fef.projectcodex.co](http://fef.projectcodex.co/). There's even a special section on [Grid Systems](http://fef.projectcodex.co/frameworks.html#grid-systems).
